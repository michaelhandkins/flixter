This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://flixter-handkins.herokuapp.com/">https://flixter-handkins.herokuapp.com/</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://flixter-handkins.herokuapp.com/"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.

            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>Like most website operators, Flixter collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Flixter's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Flixter's visitors use its website. From time to time, Flixter may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
      <p>Flixter also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://flixter-handkins.herokuapp.com/ blog posts. Flixter only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
      
            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>Certain visitors to Flixter's websites choose to interact with Flixter in ways that require Flixter to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Flixter gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://flixter-handkins.herokuapp.com/ to provide a username and email address.</p>
      
            <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Flixter takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
